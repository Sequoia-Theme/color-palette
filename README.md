# Sequoia Color Palette

## Usage

We provide you with the colors for all theme variants in many different formats.  
Depending on where you would like to integrate them, you need to look either in `palettes.txt` (for CSS & Co.), `tailwind.config.js` (for usage with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)), or the other files.

If you need the colors in a differnt format that isn't available yet, just open an issue and let us know!  
We'll gladly add it :)
